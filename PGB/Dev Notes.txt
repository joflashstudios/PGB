- Ideas -
Public static program class manages program state.
Use a thread per drive or network share for file copying, and keep them fed via a queue. You can stack completed files and errors or something.
^Or maybe more, if it's a lot of small files? Will have to experement.
File operations start as soon as the scan thread starts adding stuff to the queue
